Homework for Chapter 2 of Learning MySQL (2006 edition), from p. 94:

Exercises:
1) What is command completion?

In the command prompt, you can type part of the file/directory/etc. and press tab. This will automatically
complete the file/directory/etc. (it will show all possible options if more than one match the part supplied).

2) What are the relative advantages of installing MySQL using the package,
 directory archive (tarball or "no-install"), or compiled methods?
 
 The package has everything that is needed and it takes very little effort to install.

3) How do you verify the integrity of downloaded packages?

Compare the checksums--the checksum of the downloaded file should match the one on the MySQL downloads page.

4) How do you add the MySQL bin directory to the operating system path?



Additional Exercises (not in the book): 
1) Document how you installed MySQL and any issues you came across with installation. 
 (The goal is to be easy to install it again on a similar machine.)

2) Document where important files should be.

Do not forget to do a pull request when your homework is complete.
